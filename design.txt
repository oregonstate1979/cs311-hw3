To design this project, I plan on looking through the assignment instructions to see if there are seperate functions of the
assignment I can write, write them in their own file, and then eventaully combine them to form the final solution for the
assignment.

First, I see the parser is to convert all alphabetical characters to lower case. Therefore, I will start here.

Second, I'll write the code that searches for a given term in a corpus of files.

I believe I have a little bit more understanding of the assignment after reading it over again and speakin with Kevin:

We score the words in the first part of the program (# of times word is found). "Finally, you will write a program that 
searches for a given term in a corpus of files." Isn't that redundant since the first paragraph states that's how scoring 
is? So you just combine the first paragraph, with dividing document count by document count of where the word was, then 
take the log of that answer and that's it for that part (no output). Then the last part is just outputting the files where 
the term is found. What happens with the term frequency? So:
Process a - read in files and parse words
Process b - calculate how many times the word is found, outputting all words with a total count from each document.
Process c - Use process b's output to calculate term freq. Then end with just outputting the files who contain the term 
searched for.  (What about the term frequency? We do the term frequency but where do we show the total? It doesn't state 
to output that value? What's the point of term freq when we don't even use it as output?)
